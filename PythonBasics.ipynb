        "Q1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a high level programming language that is widely used today in many fields like data science, automation and artificial intelligence. It helps us give instructions to the computer in clear way. One big reason why Python is so popular is that it is very easy to learn for beginners. The rules of writing code or syntax in Python is simple and looks like normal English. Python also has many stored libraries and tools that helps in doing complicated tasks. It is also widely used by big companies like Google, Netflix and YouTube. Another reason for its popularity is that it has a large community of learners as it has wide range of support available."

        "  - An interpreter in Python is a special program that reads and runs the Python code line by line. It checks each line one at a time and shows the result immediately. This helps us easily find mistakes and fix them while writing the code. Because of the this we don't have to wait for the whole program to run at last, it shows the output step by step. This is one reason why Python is good for learning and testing small pieces of code."

We cannot use them for anything else like variable names because they are already reserved by Python. These keywords help Python understand what kind of action we want to perform in our code. For example, words like if, else, while, for, True and False are all keywords. They are used to write conditions, loops and other important parts of a program. Python has a set of these keywords that we must use correctly for the code to work."

If they are used as a variable name, Python will get confused and show an error. For example, we can't use words like if, while, or True as variable names because they are already reserved by Python."

For example, lists are mutable and we can add, remove or change items in a list. On the other hand, if something is immutable it means we cannot change it once it is made. For example, strings and tuples are immutable and if we try to change them Python will create a new object instead."

        "  - Lists are mutable because they are made in a way that allows us to change, add or remove items after the list is created. This makes lists useful when we need to work with data that can change during the program. On the other hand, tuples are immutable, which means we cannot change their values once they are created. This is because tuples are used when we want the data to stay fixed and safe from accidental changes. Python makes tuples immutable to protect the data and make the program run faster and more securely in some cases."

But the “is” operator checks if two variables point to the same memory location which means they are the exact same object. For example, if two lists have the same items, == will say they are equal, but is may say they are not the same object. So, == is about comparing values, while is is about checking identity in the memory."

The and operator returns True only if both conditions are true. The or operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is true. The not operator is used to reverse the result if something is true, not makes it false and if something is false, not makes it true.

        "  - Type casting in Python means changing the data type of a value from one type to another. For example, we can convert a number into a string or a string into an integer using type casting. This is useful when we want to perform operations that need a specific data type. Python has built-in functions like int(), float(), and str() that help us do type casting. For example, if we write int(\"5\") it will change the string \"5\" into the number 5. Type casting helps us work with different kinds of data smoothly in a program."

        "Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - In Python the implicit type casting happens automatically when Python changes one data type to another without us telling it to. For example, if we add an integer and a float it will automatically convert the integer into a float. This helps avoid errors and makes calculations smooth. On the other hand, explicit type casting is when we manually convert one data type into another using functions like int(), float(), or str(). We use explicit casting when we know we need to change the type for a specific purpose. So, the main difference is that implicit casting is done by Python on its own while explicit casting is done by the programmer on purpose."

These statements check if something is true or false and then run different blocks of code depending on the result. The most common conditional statements are if, elif and else. For example, if a condition is true, the if block will run. If not Python will check other conditions using elif and if none of them are true it will run the else block."

It helps us test multiple possibilities one after another. If the if condition is not true Python moves to check the elif condition. If that is true it runs the code inside it. We can use as many elif statements as we want between if and else. By this the program can choose the correct block of code to run based on which condition is true first."

For example, we use it to go through items in a list or run a loop a fixed number of times. The while loop is used when we don't know the exact number of times, and we want the loop to keep running as long as a certain condition is true. The main difference is that for loops are used for fixed repetitions and while loops are used when the number of repetitions depends on a condition."

Let's Consider a scenario where we need to read user input until a specific word, like \"quit\", is entered. As we don't know how many inputs the user will provide.
